This repository shows all the programming I've done for the summer of 2025. Important folders are described below.

# Learncpp 

Spent each week self-learning cpp through the free website. Documented quizzes and projects throughout to practice.

Hightlights: Wrote my very own 15puzzle in [`/week7-8_learncpp/puzzle15.cpp`](week7-8_learncpp/puzzle15.cpp/)

# Leetcode

Did some leetcode problems. Interesting ones are listed below, each with their own Readme.

['/LeetCode/0226-invert-binary-tree'](LeetCode/0226-invert-binary-tree/)

['/LeetCode/0404-sum-of-left-leaves'](LeetCode/0404-sum-of-left-leaves/)

['/LeetCode/0904-leaf-similar-trees'](LeetCode/0904-leaf-similar-trees/)

['/LeetCode/0563-binary-tree-tilt'](LeetCode/0563-binary-tree-tilt/)

These were mostly just for fun and to practice pointers.

# Webots

Wrote a webots simulation to collect lidar data and feed it to a matlab SLAM algorithm to make an occupancy map.
